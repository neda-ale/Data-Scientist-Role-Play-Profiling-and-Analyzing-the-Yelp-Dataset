Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 rows , 3 columns
ii. Business table = 10000 rows , 12 columns
iii. Category table = 10000 rows , 2 columns
iv. Checkin table = 10000 rows , 3 columns
v. elite_years table = 10000 rows , 2 columns
vi. friend table = 10000 rows , 2 columns
vii. hours table = 10000 rows , 2 columns
viii. photo table = 10000 rows , 4 columns
ix. review table = 10000 rows , 9 columns
x. tip table = 10000 rows , 5 columns
xi. user table = 10000 rows , 20 columns
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours =1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000 (id)
viii. Tip = 3979 (business_id) & 537(user_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes business with star rating 2-3 have different distribution hours with business with star rating 4-5.
In the city of Toronto business with higher star rating have more working days but it is different for different kind of business and also depends on what kind of business it is.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes in the city of Toronto totally the higher rating businesses have more reviews but again it differs based on the nature of business. 
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Yes based on their neighborhood we can understand which areas have higher rank stars and which ereas have lower rank stars.

SQL code used for analysis:

select business.city, AVG(business.stars) AS business_star, business.review_count,
count(hours.hours) , category.category, business.neighborhood,
case
WHEN AVG(business.stars)>=2 and AVG(business.stars)<=3 THEN "2-3 stars"
WHEN AVG(business.stars)>=4 and AVG(business.stars)<=5 THEN "4-5 stars"
else "other"
END AS star_rating
from business inner join category
on category.business_id = business.id
inner join hours 
on hours.business_id = business.id
where city ="Toronto"
group by stars;



2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that 
are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The businesses which are open get more reviews.
                 Open:   AVG(review_count) = 31.757
                 Closed: AVG(review_count0 = 23.198
         
         
ii. Difference 2: The businesses which are open have slightly higher rating.
                   Open:   AVG(stars) = 3.679
                   Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.520         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	select AVG(stars), count(review_count), is_open
from business
group by is_open;

	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting
 the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and 
 come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do: 
I want to know where is the neighborhood in Toronto with the most successful business. In other word where in Toronto we can see the highest ranking stars and reveiews and is still open restaurants. 
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
I need the category of the businesses, their neighborhoods, their star ranking, their review counts and also I need to know if this business is still open or not. I filtered my search by choosing businesses with stars higher than 4.5 and more than 20 reviews. Interestingly no businesses with these criterias is shut. Plus I found two major neighborhoods with the most successful businesses. 
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+---------------------------+----------------+-------+--------------+---------+

+---------------------------+----------------+-------+--------------+---------+
